This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Muddapu, V. R., and Chakravarthy, V. S. (2020). A Multi-Scale 
Computational Model of Excitotoxic Loss of Dopaminergic Cells 
in Parkinson’s Disease. bioRxiv, 2020.02.20.957704.

# Usage
This is a MATLAB model. To run, launch MATLAB and then:

1. Set the current/working directory to your MuddapuHEM2020 repository folder
2. At the MATLAB command line, enter: RUN_HEM_model
3. Wait a few seconds (or minutes, if your computer doesn't have a GPU) for the model to run
4. The code will print out a file name and some example commands for loading and plotting results

The authors' original README file also had the following comment:
"See into RUN_HEM_model.m file to reproduce the different results from the paper"
